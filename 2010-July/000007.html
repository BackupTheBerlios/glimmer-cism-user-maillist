<PRE>Hi all,
sorry for the cross-posting but I think this email should reach everyone.

In short, I will forward every [1] question regarding Glimmer-CISM I 
receive to one of the mailing lists as appropriate and I would encourage 
everyone else who receives emails directly regarding GC to do the same.

We currently have 29 subscribers of the user mailing list and 30 
subscribers of the developer list. 21 subscribers are subscribed to both 
lists and in total we have 38 people that can be reached through one of 
the mailing lists. As a group this represents a significant body of 
knowledge both specific to the inner workings of Glimmer-CISM and ice 
sheet and climate modelling in general. I think (and that certainly goes 
for myself) the group is much more knowledgeable then any individual. 
Therefore, you will get better answers on the mailing list.

There are other benefits to using the mailing list: The lists are 
archived and newcomers (and obviously us as well) can browse these 
archives to find solutions to previous problems.

However, another very import reason is that having an active mailing 
list indicates and active and healthy project, which will attract more 
people.

There are other ways to engage with the project:
1. We have the forums
    <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/forum/?group_id=10995">http://developer.berlios.de/forum/?group_id=10995</A>
    which could get used in a similar way. Personally, I prefer the
    mailing lists because I get the emails automatically and do not need
    to actively monitor another thing [2].
2. Other BerliOS features: bug tracker, task manager, support and
    feature requests:
    * The bug tracker is very useful and we should make more use of it.
    * I just realised that we have an item in the support manager since
      March which we haven't dealt with, that's bad.
    * Feature and task manager are also useful to organise ourselves what
      we want to do for our next releases.

Again, making use of these features increases the visibility of our 
project and allows us all to participate in the project, communicate 
with each other and coordinate our efforts to produce a most excellent 
and useful ice sheet model.

Cheers
magi

[1] obviously, there might be genuinely private matters which I might 
decide to pass on the steering committee or deal with directly.
[2] well, you can get forum posts automatically mailed and reply to them 
using email, which I do. But then, the formus are no different from the 
mailing list and are just another thing to search through for solutions.
