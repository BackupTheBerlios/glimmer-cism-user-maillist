Subject: [Glimmer-cism-user] total mass balance and ice loss at marine
	margins
Message-ID: <CAKCgpkZnNLfHs1GpzNdbbj8JpwNqF8rVb7pKR8wy0g=joE2Rbw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a question regarding the mass balance in the GLIMMER ice sheet
model.
Most of the time I have diagnosed the surface mass balance, but in my case I
would like to study the total mass balance of the Northern Hemisphere Ice
sheets during glacial cycles, including the individual terms
of accumulation, ablation, melting at bottom, calving and ice that is lost
to the ocean when it flows across the marine ice margin.

Has somebody experience with the total mass balance of GLIMMER in
particular:

(1) In the output, the calving terms are in units of [m]. Does this
represent a time integral from one time step to another?
(2) Can one enable output for accumulation and ablation separately?
(3) And how do I estimate the ice-volume lost by the marine-margin/
marine-limit parameterization?

Thanks for your response(s).


Oliver
(PS: I use GLIMMER Version 1.7.1)
