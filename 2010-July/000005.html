<PRE>Hi Oliver,
welcome to Glimmer-CISM
:<i>-)
</I>
first of all and to get some administrivia I would strongly suggest to 
subscribe to the user and maybe the developer mailing lists. You will 
reach a much larger audience by sending questions to the mailing lists.

Secondly, which version of GLIMMER and now Glimmer-CISM are you using? 
Glimmer has recently moved to
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/glimmer-cism/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/glimmer-cism/</A>
and we are in the process of releasing version 1.6.

</I>&gt;<i> first of all let me express my how thankful I'm to you and your team 
</I>&gt;<i> that had the vision of creating a community ice-sheet model!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>well, I should point out that it's now a rather large group of active 
developers of Glimmer-CISM so I really cannot claim sole responsibility :-)

&gt;<i> I'm currently working an coupling between GLIMMER and LOVECLIM, and I'm

</I>&gt;<i> LOVECLIM's preindustrial control run and just recently LGM climate 
</I>&gt;<i> anomalies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>that's very interesting, will you make your code available? We already 
have a number of climate model couplers and would certainly be happy to 
add another one as add on.


&gt;<i> Your documentation is very good and so far I could - even as a beginner 
</I>&gt;<i> in ice-sheet modeling - understand and solve most of my initial problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>excellent! That's very nice to hear.


&gt;<i> However, right now I have two specific questions and maybe you have some 
</I>&gt;<i> quick advice for me:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to use the marine_margin=4  option with the marine-limit=-200
</I>&gt;<i> for the Northern Hemisphere (30-90N in a coarse crude projection)
</I>&gt;<i> and try to create LGM ice-sheets over the Hudson Bay area.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the marine_margin does not seem to work as I understood it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ice grows into regions where the bedrock (topg) is below -200m, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What configuration is best to simulate ice-sheets with a marine_margin 
</I>&gt;<i> limit of -200m.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Calving is certainly one of the darker corners of Glimmer-CISM.

Ice is only calved through the marine margin. Option 4 removes all ice 
on a marginal node below a certain depth. If it doesn't do it then it's 
a bug :-(. Is there a large area of ice below your marine limit?

Option 2 might work better since that removes all ice below certain depth.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What assumptions do ice-sheet modelers use for the balance/ relaxation 
</I>&gt;<i> of the present-day bedrock topography. I simply 'ingnored' the fact that 
</I>&gt;<i> some regions are not in equilibrium. Are there reference maps available 
</I>&gt;<i> how the equilibrium bedrock topography would look like for present day 
</I>&gt;<i> ice-sheets (globally). What initial states do ice-sheet modelers use for 
</I>&gt;<i> present-day ice-sheet simulations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>this is somewhat tricky, because the isostatic adjustment depends on the 
  ice history. I guess you could use a global loading history, e.g. Dick 
Peltier's ICE-5g to initialise the isostatic module. This would be quite 
a good addition to GC (any volunteers?). For my predictive runs (using a 
predecessor of Glimmer) I started the runs in the past and continued 
into the future. Again, you have the problem of what initial topography 
to use. However, if your simulated present day topo resembles the actual 
present day topo you can have some confidence that you are not too far off.


&gt;<i> Do you have references where I can find more about the performance of 
</I>&gt;<i> GLIMMER for present day ice-sheet simulations, and LGM or Eemian?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>We should really have a list of Glimmer-CISM publications. 
Unfortunately, we currently don't have one and I have been away from GC 
for a while, so I will leave this question to others to answer.

Again, welcome to Glimmer-CISM. And again, I would strongly encourage 
you to subscribe to the mailing lists and get involved in GC development.

Cheers
magnus
